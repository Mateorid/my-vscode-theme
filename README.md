Provides Visual Studio Code/VSCode Editor Color Scheme for Jetbrains IDEs (webstorm, Intellij, Rider & many more);
While Jetbrains IDEs are great for productivity unfortunately the highlighting is not very
intuitive. This plugin attempts to make the IDE fairly **close** to VSCode Dark+ theme. 

> Note - Some text colors might not be accurate due to either Jetbrains does not allow us to override those colors or the default colors were more intuitive.
