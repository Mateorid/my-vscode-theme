<!-- Plugin description -->
Provides Visual Studio Code / VSCode Editor Color Scheme for Jetbrains IDEs (webstorm, Intellij, Rider & many more);
While Jetbrains IDEs are great for productivity unfortunately the highlighting is not very
intuitive. This plugin attempts to make the IDE fairly **close** to VSCode theme. 

> Note - Some text colors might not be accurate due to either Jetbrains does not allow us to override those colors or the default colors were more intuitive.

#### Themes:

**Dark:**
- VSCode Dark+
- VSCode Dark Modern

**Light:**
- VSCode Light Modern (Experimental - Feel free to submit bugs at https://github.com/dinbtechit/vscode-theme/issues)

**For Best Viewing Experience:** 
- Plugins: VSCode Theme + Rainbow Brackets

### Supported Languages
- Advance Syntax highlighting Support: 
  - JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Dart/Flutter, Rust, Python, Kotlin, C#/F#, Php, Go
  - C, C++ and Objective-C
- Basic Syntax highlighting:
  - Ruby and many more. 

### Supported Platforms
